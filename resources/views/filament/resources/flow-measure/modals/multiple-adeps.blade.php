<div>
    <p>You have submitted a departure flow restriction applying to multiple airports.
        This is <strong>usually incorrect</strong> as it requires the flow measure to be coordinated across multiple
        airports. If you have arranged/agreed this with a flow manager to coordinate on the network, you may proceed.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>The more likely situation is that you are trying to apply the departure flow restriction separately to multiple
        airports. For this you must issue separate flow measures</p>
