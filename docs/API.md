# API

We allow you to call our API to get all our flow measures, FIR deatils and event data. Quetsions about the API can be posted in the #web-platform-questions channel in discord.

We are interested to know what the community develops, so please do inform us what you have created using our API.

### Version 1.0 - Active

Please see our [API specification for version 1.0](https://ecfmp.vatsim.net/docs/v1)

### Acceptable Use

At present, we don't restrict how often you can call our API, however we ask that you don't use it excessively. We consider it reasonable to call our flow measures endpoint up to once every minute, however our FIRs and events don't change commonly. Therefore calling a new FIR ID with an new flow measure is reasonable, however re-calling it every minute is not.
