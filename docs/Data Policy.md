#### 4.2 Procedures

Details on how to exercise rights in relation to the data held is detailed in the relevant sections of this policy.

### (5) Right of Access

#### 5.1 Responsibility
    
Requests for personal data under the 'Right of Access' are the responsibility of the Network Management Team. Such requests are to be compiled within one month of the request being received. If circumstances prevent this from occurring, an extension of a further two months may be instituted by ECFMP, providing that the member making the request is informed of this before the expiration of the original one month deadline.

#### 5.2 Procedure for Making a Request

Right to access requests must be sent to [ecfmp@vateud.net](mailto:ecfmp@vateud.net). 
        
If a member at a lower level to that of the Network Management Team that might reasonably be construed to be a request for access, they have the responsibility to notify the Network Management team without delay.

#### 5.3 Provision for Verifying Data

Where the person managing the access request is unable to confirm the identity of the requester there should be a provision for checking their identity before releasing any data.

#### 5.4 Charging

It is anticipated that simple requests will not incur a charge/fee. ECFMP reserves the right to impose a fee where it should be required, for example due to volume of requests or complexity of data.

#### 5.5 Procedure for Granting Access

All requests are to be sent to [ecfmp@vateud.net](mailto:ecfmp@vateud.net).

Personal data shall only be shared with the individual to whom it relates. Other individuals’ data will be redacted before data is passed to the requesting member.

### (6) Right to Rectification

#### 6.1 Responsibility

Accurate data is in the best interests of both the Network and the membership. The Network Management Team is responsible for the management of such requests.

Right to rectification requests shall be sent to [ecfmp@vateud.net](mailto:ecfmp@vateud.net).

If a member at a lower level to that of the Network Management Team receives a request for rectification that might reasonably be expected to fulfil it, they have the responsibility to notify the Network Management team without delay.

#### 6.3
There is no charge/fee associated with making a right of rectification request.

### (7) Lawful Basis

#### 7.1 Legitimate Interest

ECFMP asserts that it has a legitimate interest in collecting and storing personal data outlined above. The reasons for this claim are:

- ECFMP is a voluntary community promoting flight simulation, virtual air traffic control, management of busy events and members seeking to join have an obvious interest in such activities.
- The data collected is the minimum required to allow for the running of the ECFMP Network.
- That the data is necessary to allow for the Network Management Team to properly manage the network both in day to day operations and in circumstances where a member may act in a manner contrary to the guidelines published by ECFMP.

#### 7.2 Data for Minors

ECFMP relies on VATSIM to ensure that parental consent is collected from users unable to provide their own consent (because they fall below the minimum age to do so, as defined under the GDPR or other local regulations).

ECFMP acknowledges its responsibility to inform VATSIM of any member that may be below this age and that are actively participating on the network without suitable consent.

#### 7.3 Opting Out

Notwithstanding ECFMP’s claim of legitimate interest, members may object to this claim and/or request that ECFMP cease processing their data. These two rights are known as the Right to Object and the Right to Restrict Processing.

Members must be aware that if they choose to exercise either of these rights, ECFMP is obliged to lock their account in order to comply with their wishes and their request may be referred to VATSIM to take the appropriate action for their network account too.

#### 7.4 Timing of Opting Out

While a notification of an objection to ECFMP’s claim of legitimate interest or a request to suspend processing may be made at any time. Such claims may not be made retrospectively.

### (8) Right of Erasure

#### 8.1 Responsibility

Requests of personal data under the Right of Erasure are the responsibility of the Network Management Team. Such requests are to be compiled within one month of the request. If circumstances prevent this from occurring, an extension of a further two months may be instituted by ECFMP, providing that the member making the request is informed of this before the expiration of the original one month deadline.

#### 8.2 Procedure for Making a Request

Right of erasure requests must be sent to [ecfmp@vateud.net](mailto:ecfmp@vateud.net).
        
#### 8.3 Provision for Verifying Data

 there should be a provision for checking their identity before releasing any data.

#### 8.4 Charging

There is no charge/fee associated with making a right of erasure request.

#### 8.5 Procedure for Granting Erasure
        
ECFMP shall evaluate all requests for erasure. ECFMP reserves the right to retain any data it believes is in its legitimate interest to do so or that is required to establish, exercise or defend any legal claim.
