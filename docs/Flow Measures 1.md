# Best Practice
Flow measures are designed to provide a traffic restriction to ease traffic congestion. A good flow measure should be targeted, proportional, practical and should balance restriction with network enjoyment.

### Targeted

A planned event does not necessarily need flow measures to balance traffic and likewise, poorly targeted flow measures will not necessarily balance traffic. By identifying or monitoring the traffic flow, restrictions can be placed on specific traffic streams to reduce workload.

When applying flow measures further away from your airspace, the longer until you will see any effect. It is bad practice to issue a flow measure applicable to controllers 3 hours away for an event that ends in 2 hours.

### Proportional

Flow measures apply extra work to controllers across the network. Therefore extreme measures like a groundstop, or flow measures applying to the whole or Europe for minor events should be avoided.

### Practical

Given the lack of global  24/7 coverage, application of flow measures to areas that are not staffed is impractical. It is encouraged that you request ATC in advance of an event for an area you think will be key to your flow strategy.

Likewise insisting that a neighbouring sector provides a high number of miles in trail for traffic inbound to you is only achievable if that area is well staffed. Flow measures should enable you to share the workload between controllers.

### Balanced

Flow measures are necessary, however keeping large delays in force to pilots disincentives them from flying again. Pilot and ATC enjoyment must be balanced.

# Create a Flow Measure

Flow measures created for a planned event **should** be linked to an event in the ECFMP system. They can be issued without, however it increases the awareness of adjacent controllers. Start by creating an event if one doesn’t already exist.

A flow measure is created on the system via the Flow Measures pages. You are required to have Flow Manager permissions for some FIRs in order to submit a measure. Any flow manager can submit any type of measure, however you must only issue restrictions that you understand and are competent to issue.

### Step 1
Select the event, if applicable. This will auto-populate the FIR field, which you must check.

Select the FIR. This is the FIR issuing the flow restriction and will restrict who can modify it. 

Start and End times are in UTC. They are when the flow measure will be in effect for. There is no facility to have an ‘indefinite’ measure, however end times can be modified. Therefore you should select the time you estimate the measure will need to last for. When in doubt, over-estimate the duration.

Reason should be provided for all flow measures, even if considered obvious. This message should specifically indicate the flow limitation (e.g. EDDH landing rate, Jever sector capacity). The presence of an event is not in itself a reason to require flow control.
