## State of Flow Measure
A flow measure can be submitted up to 10 days in advance of an event. Flow measures that are not active are termed ‘notified’ by the Flow system and become ‘active’ automatically at the time specified.

When flow measures come to their end time, they are listed on the system as ‘expired’ and are visible for several hours afterwards. Flow measures can be ‘deleted’ in addition, which will classify them as withdrawn and immediately remove them from the flow system.


## Notifications in ECFMP

The ECFMP system will issue a notification of the flow control measure in the ECFMP server 24 hours before it is active. For flow measures submitted within 24 hours of the start date, the notification will be sent immediately. This notification will “tag” the relevant users that you have included in the FAO field.

A further notification is sent in ECFMP when the flow measure becomes active and again when it expires or is withdrawn. Flow measures created in the last 30 minutes will not re-tag FIR staff. 

New flow measures ask flow staff to acknowledge the receipt so that they can be propagated to controllers.

## Notifications in your Discord

Official Division/vACC/FIR discords can provide us with a webhook to post flow measures to your own discord server. These will be posted along the same timescale of ECFMP server notifications and will by default not send a tag. Should you wish them to tag a group, you must provide us with the discord ID of that group. 

We remind flow managers of the need to react/respond to flow measures via ECFMP.

Please contact @Kieran Hardern or the NMT via the ECFMP discord to set this up.
